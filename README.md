# OscarUpsets

This repository contains files related to forecasting the Oscars. Twenty-five years of movie data were scraped from [Oscars.org](http://www.oscars.org/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/), and [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), using Selenium. Several classification algorithms in scikit-learn were used to predict Best Picture winners. The files will be updated throughout the 2017-2018 Oscar season.
