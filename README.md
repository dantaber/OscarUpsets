# OscarUpsets

This repository contains files related to forecasting the Oscars. Twenty-five years of movie data were scraped from [Oscars.org](http://www.oscars.org/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/), and [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), using Selenium. Several classification algorithms in scikit-learn were used to predict Best Picture winners.

Results were used to predict the 2018 Oscars. Based on data collected through March 3, 2018, I'm calling an upset! The model thinks Get Out will win Best Picture. (So does common sense.)
